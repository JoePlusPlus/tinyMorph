# Welcome to TinyMorph! 

TinyMorph is a little project about image processing using GAN's
and other fancy architectures. We will provide a simple base model to be tinkered with
and will ultimately include a "research report" on all the variations we tested
during the process. There might be a front-end to play with images.

We will be using trensorflows pretrained models (like VGG-19) and make use
of ImageNet for data of different sizes & categories.

# Workflow

 1. get a generic pipeline going, using a pretrained VGG-19 (tensorflow)
